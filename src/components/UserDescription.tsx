        Iâ€™m from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Iâ€™m working with JS since 2022. My
        goal is to learn new technologies and become a FrontEnd Architect. I
        code in JavaScript, React, Sass, Material UI. I also have knowledge of
        Node with Express in the backend. I would love to learn Three js and
        Blender to make amazing things in the web. I'm currently practicing
        Nextjs :)
